# Project History

**2021**  
· Late May      — the idea emerged to create an alternative shell for any Android firmware  
· June          — first alpha version (just a set of apps that could work together)  
· August        — the project received a name, a logo, and its first relatively stable build  
· September–October — a major redesign, though it was still far from being a complete system  
· December      — final version.

**2022**  
· November      — a tablet-oriented fork (different name, UI adapted for large screens, slightly more functionality)

**2023–early 2024**  
· Development almost stopped  
· In 2023, an updated version based on different apps was released; it became the last one.

**2025**  
· September     — project restart  
· Completely new name and logo  
· Key change: the author (not being a programmer) began actively using neural networks to generate code, while most of the apps themselves are created by people (Material Files, KISS Launcher).  
· The structure changed and became closer to AROS (Workbench) and Plan 9; the implementation was also reworked with added compatibility  
· The old name and logo were intentionally omitted from the public history

**2026**  
· The project exists in its current form  
· Terminal → Components → Launcher → Material Files — the core quartet  
· Everything else is up to the user  
· Development is slow, but the project is already stable.
